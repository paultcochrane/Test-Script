1.10      2015-05-12 05:15:41 -0400
  - Work around for buggy IPC::Run3 0.048 on MSWin32
    On Windows we probe for and mitigate a bug in IPC::Run3
    (see https://github.com/plicease/Test-Script/issues/1 for details)
    with the intention of removing the workaround if/when IPC::Run3
    is fixed.

1.09      2015-05-07 16:44:26 -0400
  - If IPC::Run3::run3 throws an exception it will now fail the test
    (with a helpful diagnostic) rather than crashing the test script.
  - A script that is killed with a singnal is now considered a failure
    as well.
  - Use alternate expected exit and signal values with options as the
    second argument to script_runs.
  - Ability to pass input via stdin to the script with script_runs.
  - Ability to capture stdout and stderr from script with script_runs.
  - Functions to test stdout and stderr:
      script_stdout_is
      script_stdout_isnt
      script_stdout_like
      script_stdout_unlike
      script_stderr_is
      script_stderr_isnt
      script_stderr_like
      script_stderr_unlike
